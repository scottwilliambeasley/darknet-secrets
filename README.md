# darknet-secrets
A simple PHP/JS application that displays random comments from a darknet database.

The database is made up of the posts and related comments that used to be on a darknet site formerly known as "Confess Your Secrets". 

It's filled with mostly depraved and somewhat hilarious comments.. more or less similar to what you see on a 4chan thread.

The database was obtained from [this link](
http://www.filedropper.com/secrets) linked in [this reddit thread](https://removeddit.com/r/onions/comments/7am3kr/later_folks_i_just_shutdown_confess_your_secrets/).

A demo instance may be found at the following [link](http://server3-public.digitalpoltergeist.com/deepwebconfession.php).
